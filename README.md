If any bugs are found, feel free to notify me or add your own fix and request a merge.

## How the game works
  * Run the Main class in your IDE after installing the repository
  * Press A or D to turn left or right respectively
  * Some bricks will turn red on impact, this means you must hit them again to destroy them and get the score
  * Get as many bricks as possible, if you lose all your lives the map resets and your score resets aswell
